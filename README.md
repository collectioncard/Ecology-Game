# Ecology Game
A simple game made in [GDevelop](https://github.com/4ian/GDevelop) based upon the built in RPG template. This game was developed as a learning exercise for CMPM 80k at the University of California, Santa Cruz.

This game allows the player to pick fruit, compost it and then replant it. The eventual goal of the game is to have a large surplus of food for the player to eat.
